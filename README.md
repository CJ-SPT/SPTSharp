# SPTSharp
- Porting AKI to C#
- This does not and will never fully work, im doing this for my own learning experience.
- Only basic types are complete, and the first few launcher routes. Many refactors to come as I progress.

# Build instructions
- Open the solution and build as a normal c# project. It will use AKI's modules, data, and launcher. Current data working set included in the project, launcher and modules are not.
- Uses client 0.14.1.1.28965
