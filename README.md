# SPTSharp
- Porting AKI to C#
- This does not and will never fully work, im doing this for my own learning experience.

# Build instructions
- Open the solution and build as a normal c# project. It will use AKI's modules, data, and launcher. Current data working set included in the project, launcher and modules are not.
